If you'd like to take my website's code, go ahead. Just note that
some of the programs are proprietary, not open source like the
website.
I am also not the owner of some programs, but I am permitted to use this site as a method of distribution, as noted in the LWJGL license and SoundSystem (www.paulscode.com) license.
